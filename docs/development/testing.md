# Testing

Run all managed and native tests with:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

Unit tests must not require audio hardware, a real `/proc`, Steam, or a controller. Use fixtures and fake backends. Real PipeWire qualification is a separate integration/manual layer and must use controlled silent streams where possible.

Resolver coverage includes missing/disappearing processes, ambiguous desktop entries, native applications, browser identity, executable fallback, Flatpak sandbox metadata, Snap wrapper fixtures, and Proton fixtures. Native coverage focuses on lifecycle, event translation, ownership, commands, and reconnect behavior.

The opt-in isolated PipeWire test is enabled with `FADRIO_RUN_PIPEWIRE_INTEGRATION=1 ./scripts/test.sh`. It uses a private runtime directory and unlinked silent streams, leaving the user's normal PipeWire instance and applications untouched.

Browser qualification evidence and its reproducible checklist are documented in [qualifying-browser.md](qualifying-browser.md).
PipeWire restart and command-recovery evidence is documented in [qualifying-reconnect.md](qualifying-reconnect.md).
Native ownership and sanitizer coverage is documented in [native-sanitizers.md](native-sanitizers.md).
Rendered mixer gesture/reconnect evidence and the opt-in desktop test are documented in [qualifying-ui-interactions.md](qualifying-ui-interactions.md). That check now defaults to host fonts and covers malformed application-icon fallback; see [the current row qualification](qualifying-application-rows.md). The original font-startup cause and the wider desktop matrix remain open.
