# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and releases will use semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `FAD-0502` Application-row slice: asynchronous validated local PNG icons with text fallback, playing/idle/muted state, and accessible mixed-volume help. Output-device controls remain pending.

- `FAD-0202` Secure local PNG icon resolution with trusted XDG roots, bounded caching, and traversal, symlink, malformed-file, and size protections.
- `FAD-0203` Flatpak-first canonical identity from bounded sandbox metadata and exported host desktop entries.
- `FAD-0204` Optional Snap identity from corroborated wrapper metadata without invoking or depending on Snap tooling.
- `FAD-0206` Advanced `fadrioctl inspect` diagnostics for canonical identity evidence and per-session audio state, with deterministic share-safe redaction.
- `REL-00003` Firefox qualification covers the installed `firefox-bin` runtime, one-row grouping, visible launcher/icon preference, ambiguity safety, and executable fallback.
- `FAD-0301` XDG user-data paths and SQLite startup with versioned, checksummed, transactional schema migrations.
- `FAD-0302` Durable application identity records, allowlisted evidence, and custom name/icon overrides with opaque keys for sensitive fallback identities.
- `FAD-0501` Live Avalonia application rows from immutable mixer snapshots, with per-application volume and mute commands and reconnect-aware controls.

### Changed

- `FAD-0502` Application controls now use a horizontally scrollable console with vertical percentage faders, aligned mute controls, logical application counts, and session-scoped System/Light/Dark selection (ADR-0003).

- `FAD-0205` XDG desktop-entry snapshots now refresh after debounced filesystem changes, advance a monotonic identity revision, and re-resolve active sessions once through the serialized mixer coordinator.
- `FAD-0206` Ordinary `fadrioctl apps` output no longer exposes process IDs; raw process and node details live in the explicit advanced inspector.
- `REL-00003` Visible XDG launchers now take precedence over hidden helpers when both have strong executable evidence; common `-bin` runtime names can match their launcher executable.
- `FAD-0503` Active mixer rows sort deterministically and stay in place during pointer/keyboard volume gestures; backend echoes cannot overwrite an active drag.
- `FAD-0503` Volume and mute commands run off the UI thread with bounded pending state, visible failure feedback, and queued-command discard on disconnect. Connected-empty and reconnecting states have distinct messages.

### Fixed

- `BUG-00003` Incremental PipeWire property updates no longer erase application identity and disable an active mixer slider.

## [0.2.0-alpha.2] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- `FAD-0020` Adopted Fadrio across the product, repository, managed projects, namespaces, executables, native ABI, application ID, local paths, documentation, tracker prefix, release artifacts, and website; replaced the former artwork with the supplied Fadrio branding package.

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- `FAD-0019` Public repository metadata, contributor setup validation, and tag-driven source-only alpha releases with SHA-256 checksums.
- `FAD-0017` Active GitHub ruleset protecting `main` through pull requests and strict Linux/native sanitizer checks.
- `REL-00002` Reproducible M0.2 qualification evidence covering real browser/Electron identity, Proton evidence, PipeWire restart recovery, and native sanitizer runs.
- `FAD-0013` Electron identity fixtures and a real VS Code terminal-bell observation resolve generic Chromium audio metadata to the installed application's name and icon.

- `FAD-0014` Initial Steam/Proton identification using bounded process evidence, cached library/manifests, conflict fixtures, and a read-only Euro Truck Simulator 2 observation.

- `FAD-0011` Hardware-free PipeWire integration coverage for application discovery, multi-session control, removal, daemon restart, and managed reconnect.
- `FAD-0012` Deterministic browser fixtures and a real Brave multi-stream qualification covering XDG identity, grouping, command fan-out, removal, and recreation.
- `FAD-0015` End-to-end PipeWire restart qualification covering unavailable state, bounded reconnect, registry replacement, stale-event rejection, and recovered commands.
- `FAD-0016` ASAN/UBSAN CI coverage for native lifecycle, callback ownership, rapid node churn, command teardown, and PipeWire reconnect.
- `FAD-0018` Theme-aware repository wordmarks and curated public presentation artwork for the FG Labs project page.

### Changed

- `FAD-0201` Application identity now scores executable and desktop metadata together, records conflicting candidates, and falls back safely instead of guessing.
- `FAD-0012` Exact PipeWire desktop-ID hints can corroborate installed applications whose launchers wrap a differently named runtime executable.

### Fixed

- `BUG-00001` Roadmap synchronization can update managed issues after their GitHub milestone is closed.
- `BUG-00002` Native volume and mute commands now complete a PipeWire round trip before short-lived clients tear down their connection.

## [0.1.0-m0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- `FAD-0001` M0 repository scaffold, .NET 10 solution, governance, licensing, documentation, and CI.
- `FAD-0002` Application-centric domain model and stable identity contracts.
- `FAD-0003` Native PipeWire C bridge with playback discovery and volume/mute commands.
- `FAD-0004` Managed native event copying and serialized event channel.
- `FAD-0005` Linux `/proc` and cached XDG application identity resolution.
- `FAD-0006` Multi-session application aggregation and immutable mixer coordination.
- `FAD-0007` Diagnostic CLI application listing, volume, and mute commands.
- `FAD-0008` Minimal Avalonia shell and theme infrastructure.
- `FAD-0010` Managed reconnect supervision and controlled multi-session qualification.
- `REL-00001` M0 build, test, native lifecycle, and live PipeWire evidence baseline.
